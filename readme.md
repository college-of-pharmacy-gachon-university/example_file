### This repository contains an example file to run the GPCR-IPL Score.

The included files are associated with the 8DCR structure, specifically a beta1-adrenergic receptor complexed with dobutamine.

We have applied a generic numbering system to the 8DCR protein, resulting in the file named "8DCR_protein_GPCRDB.pdb".

Additionally, the molecular structure of the bound dobutamine is provided in a *.mol2 format.
